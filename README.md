# yWeb

This is an updated version of the content manager that I have used over the years to create different websites:

- The Astrophysics Group at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM).
- The Study of Emission-Line Galaxies with Integral-Field Spectroscopy (SELGIFS) collaboration.
- Several scientific and outreach events:
    - Jornadas de Astronomía
    - Homenaje a Stephen Hawking

An instance of the old version (in sort of C++ ;^D) can be found on the [legacy branch](https://github.com/paranoya/yWeb/tree/legacy).
